# myvim

My Vim settings, organized as a Vim8 package.

Place this directory in a location on the pattern:

```console
% ~/.vim/pack/<ARBITRARY>/start/myvim
```

Replace `<ARBITRARY>` with an arbitrary directory name (I use `my`). For example, from the command line:

```console
% git clone https://github.com/elijahgreenstein/myvim ~/.vim/pack/my/start/myvim
```
